To separate the values by a tab so that the columns are nicely aligned, you can use the \"character\" `\\t`.  So `\\n` inserts a new line and `\\t` inserts a tab.

Luckily, the people who created the `numpy` library thought this too. They figured out how to do almost all the stuff we just did in 1 line of code. This can be done using `numpy.loadtxt()` and `numpy.loadtxt()`\n",

    "\n",
    "The `.loadtxt` function takes in the file path/name as a string (make sure you keep track of its directory path and if your notebook is in the same directory then don't worry about including the directory) we set the delimiter parameter to a comma so numpy knows how to seperate everything the way we want. Finally we use the skiprows argument and we set it to 1 to skip the first row of the file because the first row has the names of each column. "
