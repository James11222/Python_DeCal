# Python_DeCal_2020

## Welcome to the Python DeCal Home Resources Page

Here you can find all relevant files to the course, all homeworks, workbooks, lecture slides, etc... for the Python DeCal: Introduction to Python Programming for Astronomers at UC Berkeley. The course will be taught by James Sunseri, Wendy Wan, and Yilun Ma

Note that most materials are adapted from previous instructors of the Python DeCal, Physics 77, and CS61A. We are creating what we believe to be the most useful resources and problem sets for learning how to use python in a scientific setting.
