    "This homework is all about introductory plotting and data analysis in python! This is by far the most important skill to take away from this course. You will use plotting any where you go, whether that is in physics or astronomy, data science, economics, biology, or even social sciences! Being able to represent your data in a visual manor is absolutely a crucial skill to have. This homework and the next will be arguably the most important homeworks of the semester. \n",

This guide is pretty exhaustive on the basics and should contain a lot of useful information on how to create just about any plot you could possibly need in Python."

    "Like we showed in lecture this week, the numpy library is a great way to load up a data array to work on. If you have a csv file full of data you'd like to analyze but there's no way to get at it, it's a pretty poor system. This problem will walk you through using `numpy.loadtxt()` to get at the data you have loaded on a csv!\n",

    "\n",
    "The `.loadtxt` function takes in the file path/name as a string (make sure you keep track of its directory path and if your notebook is in the same directory then don't worry about including the directory) we set the delimiter parameter to a comma so numpy knows how to seperate everything the way we want. Finally we use the skiprows argument and we set it to 1 to skip the first row of the file because the first row has the names of each column. "

This means you should always have a descriptive title, x and y axis labels, the figure should be large enough to actually read (I recommend using `figsize=(10,8)` or widths and heights close to that ratio and magnitude to make nice large plots. Look at the Beautifying Plots section of the Ultimate Plotting Guide to see how to really make your plots stand out from the rest (this is not required). \n",
