Use the `scipy.misc.derivative()` function with `order=3` to estimate the derivative of the $cos(x)$ and compute the difference relative to the analytical result (what you would get doing it by hand), and plot this difference. I give you a function to calculate the derivative from scratch using a centered method, plot the difference between this and the analytical result as well. Feel free to try changing some of the parameters like `dx` or `order` and see how they impact your result.\n",
