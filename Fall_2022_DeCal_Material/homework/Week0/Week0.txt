Week 1 is only 1 lecture, it consists of a simple introduction to the instructors and interns. After that, we do icebreakers, make the semester's playlist, and go over the syllabus. We also take the last 10-15 minutes or so of lecture to help students install anaconda or some platform to access jupyter notebooks with. This lecture is completely missable and not that big a deal. We have it this way so students can continue to enroll into the course until Week 2 when the first homework assignment is released.
