In this folder I have compiled a few .fits files for you to play with. The eagle nebula, SN1987A, the sombrero galaxy, and venus in the UV band. 

To load these in you may need to install the astropy python library using pip. 

All of these .fits files were retrieved from various webpages such as:


https://www.spacetelescope.org/projects/fits_liberator/datasets_archives/

and

http://archive.eso.org/dss/dss

I highly recommend using the first link to find good quality fits files to play with and plot. If you want a tutorial on how to plot these files I would recommend visiting 


https://learn.astropy.org/rst-tutorials/FITS-images.html?highlight=filtertutorials


This is a downloadable tutorial on how to use astropy to plot images from FITS files and is largely what my notebook is based on. You can do a lot more stuff once you have a .fits file, like bin photometric data, if you have several .fits files of the same object over time you can construct a lightcurve from the data, and so on. I hope this helps you explore. In general, great resources for astronomy data are

SIMBAD
VIZIER
GAIA
SDSS
2MASS

These are astronomy data bases of the entire night sky.
