The `for` and `while` loops are used for so many different things in the world of programming and we will give you a sense of this in this homework. We also cover how to format strings, and use that as a tool for some real world application problems! If you have questions go to office hours (fill out the poll if you haven't already) or ask on the class piazza page."

When the temperature exceeds a critical point, reactions begin and proceed faster as the temperature increases. In the egg white the proteins start to coagulate for temperatures above 63 C, while in the  yolk the proteins start to coagulate for temperatures above 70 C. For a soft boiled egg, the white needs to have been heated long enough to coagulate at a temperature above 63 C, but the yolk should not be heated above 70 C.
