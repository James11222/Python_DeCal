The purpose of your fit is to determine the values of $\\{\\theta_j\\}$ and (hopefully) their uncertainties. An example of a model is:\n",

The value of the $\\chi^2_{\\min}$ can be interpreted as a goodness-of-fit. The parameters $\\{\\theta_j\\}$ that minimize $\\chi^2$ have probabilistic interpretation\n",
    "1. You know that the errors are Gaussian and are the same for each data point, but you do not know their magnitude. In this case, you would minimize the sum of squares: $\\mathcal{S} = \\sum \\left(y_i - y(x_i;\\theta)\\right)^2$. Then value of $\\mathcal{S}$ can be used to *estimate* the errors $\\sigma_i$ for each data point: $\\sigma_i = \\sqrt{\\mathcal{S}/(N_\\mathrm{data}-N_\\mathrm{parameters})}$\n",
