For this problem we will actually make a pretty relevant plot to the state of the world in 2020. As someone who has taken the Python DeCal you will be able to say that you have worked with real COVID-19 Data. So often we simply listen to people tell us about the data, but you should be able to look at it yourself (to reduce bias of course). \n",
