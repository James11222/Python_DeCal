As we went over in lecture, ODEs are important for determining equations that are defined by their rates of change. An example that you will encounter early on is projectiles. We will be looking at an ideal projectile that does not experience drag or any other force aside from gravity. That equation is shown as:\n",

    "\n",
    "We want to find the position of the projectile, which we could do by taking two integrals of that acceleration, which would get us a parabolic equation with some initial conditions. In this case, it is a fairly easy integral to do by hand, but as you get further into math and physics you get very complex ODEs so computers come in to do these ODEs numerically; there are some diff eqs that can only be solved numerically with computers."
