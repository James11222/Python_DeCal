    "1. Use semi descriptive variables. DO NOT represent every variable as a single letter. This leads to ambiguity and makes it very difficult to understand/read your code when you come back to it, it also makes it difficult on us when we grade your homework. Examples: use temp instead of t, radius instead of r, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Leave comments as frequently as needed to make it easy to understand for people reading, especially in your functions. We recommend a docstring under the name of your functions describing what it does. Docstring is a comment using triple quotes of the form (\"\"\"________\"\"\") \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stay consistent with your line spacing, try to make it as comprehensible as possible. Cramped up code with no spacing inbetween is not very pleasing to the eye and can get overwhelming"
