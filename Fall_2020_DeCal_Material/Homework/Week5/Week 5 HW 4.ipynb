    "This homework is all about plotting in python! This is by far the most important skill to take away from this course. You will use plotting any where you go, whether that is in physics or astronomy, data science, economics, biology, or even social sciences! Being able to represent your data in a visual manor is absolutely a crucial skill to have. This homework and the next will be arguably the most important homeworks of the semester. \n",

    "If you get stuck on how to do something you have several options, I would encourage you to first take a look at **The Ultimate Plotting Guide** Notebook Posted in the Bcourses files. This guide is pretty exhaustive on the basics and should contain a lot of useful information on how to create just about any plot you could possibly need in Python."

This means you should always have a descriptive title, x and y axis labels, the figure should be large enough to actually read (I recommend using `figsize=(10,8)` or widths and heights close to that ratio and magnitude to make nice large plots. Look at the Beautifying Plots section of the Ultimate Plotting Guide to see how to really make your plots stand out from the rest (this is not required). \n",
